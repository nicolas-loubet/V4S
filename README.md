  This document has for aim explaining how we compute the V<sub>4S</sub> values for any molecule in a system, providing the code in FORTRAN and C++. Those should be adapted for each particular case. Firstly, we should explain the calculation of the tetrahedron. Secondly, the two algorithm should be explained in a generic way, so the same idea could be used in other cases.

# The perfect tetrahedron

In this first section, we will explain how to calculate the four points of the perfect tetrahedron for a water molecule. This is intended for water models such as TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP5P, SPC, SPC/E, among others. The model must have 3 coordinates for each molecule: The two hydrogens and the oxygen. This last one will be the center of the tetrahedron. The necessary steps can be summarized in two objectives:

1.  Open the angle H-O-H (not necessary if the angle is already the desirable arccos(−1/3), the perfect tetrahedron angle 109.471<sup>∘</sup> = 1, 9106rad).

2.  Locate the opposite two points that complete the tetrahedron.

In this sense, from the three initial coordinates we can find the two vectors that conform the molecule, that we should name $\\overrightarrow{OH_1}$ and $\\overrightarrow{OH_2}$.

$$\\overrightarrow{OH_i}=\\overrightarrow{H_i}-\\overrightarrow{O}$$

From this two vectors we can find the bisector. This one is parallel to the dipole moment.

$$\\overrightarrow{b}=\\frac{\\overrightarrow{OH_1}} {\\left\|\\overrightarrow{OH_1}\\right\|} + \\frac{\\overrightarrow{OH_2}} {\\left\|\\overrightarrow{OH_2}\\right\|}$$

Also, we can find a normal vector perpendicular to the two OH<sub>i</sub> vectors, using the cross product.

$$\\overrightarrow{\\eta}= \\frac{\\overrightarrow{OH_1}\\times\\overrightarrow{OH_2}} {\\left\|\\overrightarrow{OH_1}\\times\\overrightarrow{OH_2}\\right\|}$$

![Angles definitions](Diagram.png?raw=true "Angles")

Now, we can find the parameters of the plane (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0) that contains the oxygen and the two hydrogens, and, therefore, the two points corresponding to the hydrogens when the angle is open to the perfect tetrahedron angle. As we are using the vectors as if oxygen was the center of coordinates, then we must set D =  − Ax<sub>0</sub> − By<sub>0</sub> − Cz<sub>0</sub> = 0. Note that η⃗ = Ax̂ + Bŷ + Cẑ.

For computing the point i of the tetrahedron, the nearest to the H<sub>i</sub>, we should note that the dot products are:

$$\\begin{aligned}
    \\overrightarrow{oh_i} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{b} &= R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{b} \\right\| cos(\\theta)\\\\
    \\overrightarrow{oh_i} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{OH_i} &= R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{OH_i} \\right\| cos(\\theta-\\phi)\\end{aligned}$$

Being R the distance between the oxygen and each point of the tetrahedron, that we defined as 1Å.

From this data (and the plane definition), we can find the coordinates of the oh<sub>i</sub> vectors (for example, with the Cramer’s rule). Then, we can find the perfect point (h<sub>1, 2</sub>) for each one.

$$M=
    \\begin{bmatrix}
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & y\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & z\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} \\\\
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & y\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & z\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} \\\\
        A & B & C \\\\
    \\end{bmatrix}$$
$$M_x=
    \\begin{bmatrix}
        R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{b} \\right\| cos(\\theta) & y\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & z\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} \\\\
        R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{OH_i} \\right\| cos(\\theta-\\phi) & y\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & z\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} \\\\
        0 & B & C \\\\
    \\end{bmatrix}$$
$$M_y=
    \\begin{bmatrix}
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{b} \\right\| cos(\\theta) & z\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} \\\\
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{OH_i} \\right\| cos(\\theta-\\phi) & z\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} \\\\
        A & 0 & C \\\\
    \\end{bmatrix}$$
$$M_z=
    \\begin{bmatrix}
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & y\_{\\overrightarrow{b}} & R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{b} \\right\| cos(\\theta) \\\\
        x\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & y\_{\\overrightarrow{OH_i}} & R \\left\| \\overrightarrow{OH_i} \\right\| cos(\\theta-\\phi) \\\\
        A & B & 0
    \\end{bmatrix}$$
$$\\begin{aligned}
    \\overrightarrow{oh_i} &=  \\frac{\|M_x\|}{\|M\|} \\hat{x}+ \\frac{\|M_y\|}{\|M\|} \\hat{y}+  \\frac{\|M_z\|}{\|M\|} \\hat{z}\\\\
    \\overrightarrow{h_i} &= \\overrightarrow{oh_i} + \\overrightarrow{O}\\end{aligned}$$

![Medium points](Tetrahedron.png?raw=true "Tetrahedron")

At this point we finished the first part, finding two points. If the water model has already the right angle (such as SPC, SPC/E, or OPC3), you can start from here.

Using the image as a guide, we should consider the fact that the middle points of the segments between the h<sub>i</sub> and e<sub>i</sub> define a line that contains the oxygen point. Also, the distances to this one are equal. So, we can consider that $\\overrightarrow{m_h} - \\overrightarrow{O} = - \\left( \\overrightarrow{m_e} - \\overrightarrow{O} \\right)$ from this, we have $\\overrightarrow{m_e} = 2\\overrightarrow{O} - \\overrightarrow{m_h}$. Also, we can define the distance from any h<sub>i</sub> to the m<sub>h</sub> (that is equal to the distance between the e<sub>i</sub> and the m<sub>e</sub>) as δ.

Also, we need to find a vector that is parallel to the line formed by the two e<sub>i</sub> points, and the m<sub>e</sub>. As it must be perpendicular to the plane formed by the oxygen and the two h<sub>i</sub> points, then we have already found η. With this considerations, then:

$$\\begin{aligned}
    \\overrightarrow{m_h} &=  \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\overrightarrow{h_1} + \\overrightarrow{h_2} \\right)\\\\
    \\delta &= \\left\| \\overrightarrow{h_i} - \\overrightarrow{m_h} \\right\|\\\\
    \\overrightarrow{m_e} &= 2\\overrightarrow{O} - \\overrightarrow{m_h}\\\\
    \\overrightarrow{e\_{1,2}} &= \\pm \\delta \\overrightarrow{\\eta} + \\overrightarrow{m_e}\\end{aligned}$$

This way, we have found the four points from the water molecule.

# Generic algorithm

In this second section, we should explain how to compute the V<sub>4S</sub> of a molecule i, in a system of N<sub>w</sub> water molecules and N<sub>a</sub> atoms that are not water.

1.  We have to compute the four points of the perfect tetrahedron, using the equations explained before.

2.  We create 4 variables where we will calculate the total potential energy for each one of the four points, initialized as 0.

3.  In a loop, we consider each water molecule and atom in the system, different from the central molecule.

4.  We calculate the distance between this atom/molecule and the water molecule i. If it is more than 6Å, we skip it.

5.  Then, we iterate over each tetrahedron point, and calculate the distance between the atom/molecule and the tetrahedron point. Comparing the four distances, we find the one that is closest to the atom/molecule.

6.  If the distance from this closest point to the atom/molecule is 5Å or less, we calculate the potential energy interaction between the central molecule and this atom/molecule, considering Coulombic and Lennard-Jones potentials. This value is added to the variable created in the 2nd step corresponding to to this point.

7.  We repeat from step 4 with the next molecule/atom.

8.  When we have all the contributions, we find the greatest value stored in the variables. This value is V<sub>4S</sub>. The other values are reffered as V<sub>1S</sub>, V<sub>2S</sub> and V<sub>3S</sub>, that could be also useful in some cases.

We show in this GitHub some examples coded in FORTRAN and C++, as a guide. Those files should be adapted to your particular case.

The code written in FORTRAN is oriented towards procedural programmers, while the code in C++ is located in a separate folder, and corresponds to an object orientation.

Hope this is helpful :)
